/**
 Class is a recorder wrapper that takes care of all the implementation details of recording 
 trips, including starting a new trip, ending a trip, recording trip information (gps, accel, 
 etc) and storing it all within the database by interfacing with SharedModel.
 
 This class does not read the data back from the database or otherwise parse it in any way. 
 
 This class is a singleton, as it must stay running no matter the active controller, and must 
 provide an interface to all running controllers should an issue arise (like the app crashing, 
 going to background, etc etc)
